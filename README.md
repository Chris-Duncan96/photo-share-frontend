# Photo Share Frontend

Made as an exercise in an afternoon, to be seen with the Photo Share Backend repo

## Requirements
node 22+
npm 11+

## Running

If you're looking to run this against the Photo Share Backend locally, you'll need to change the url hit in page.tsx, line 15, to localhost:5000.
I meant to make that the default for running this locally, but didn't get around to it.

```
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```
npx jest
```
